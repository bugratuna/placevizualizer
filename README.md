Modern Architecture: A layered structure for the backend (controllers, models, routes) and a "feature-sliced" structure for the frontend.

Automatic Code Quality: Automatic code formatting and checking with ESLint, Prettier, and lint-staged before every commit.

Test-Driven Development: Component, hook, and integration tests with React Testing Library and Vitest.

CI/CD Integration: Automatic test, lint, and build processes with GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.

State Management: Zustand for global state management on the frontend.

Modern Interface: Material UI for a minimalist and professional user interface.
